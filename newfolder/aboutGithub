<dd><p><ul>
<li>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time <br>
so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book, you will use<br> 
software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do <br>
this with nearly any type of file on a computer.</li>
<li>If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or<br> 
layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very<br>
 wise thing to use. </li>
<li> It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project<br>
 back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something<br>
 that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a <br>
VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover.</li></ul>
</p></dd>
<dh><h3>Git and Github</h3></dh>
<dd>Git is the version control tech of choice for basically everybody right now, from developers<br>
 to designers. GitHub is the social code-hosting platform that’s currently used more than any other.<br>
 It’s a place where you can play and experiment. It’s a place where you can find (and play around <br>
with) the most incredible open-source information, emerging technologies, features, and designs. <br>
It’s a place to learn and it’s a place to get involved. You can keep code there for work or for school,<br>
 and you can grab some sweet code that you want to explore further. You can even host websites <br>
for free directly from your repository!<br>
<h4>Git Commands</h4>
<div class="child"><dl><dh><h5>git init</h5></dh>
<dd>This command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. This is the first step in creating a<br>
 repository. After running git init, adding and committing files/directories is possible.</dd>
<dh><h5>git add</h5></dh>
<dd>Adds files in the to the staging area for Git. Before a file is available to commit to a repository, <br>
the file needs to be added to the Git index (staging area).</dd>
<dh><h5>git commit</h5></dh>
<dd>Record the changes made to the files to a local repository. For easy reference, each commit has<br>
 a unique ID.</dd>
<dh><h5>git status</h5></dh>
<dd>This command returns the current state of the repository.</dd>
<dh><h5>git remote</h5></dh>
<dd>To connect a local repository with a remote repository. A remote repository can have a name set<br>
 to avoid having to remember the URL of the repository.</dd>
</dl>
</dd></dl></div></div>
